# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up touch state management and basic touch event handlers


  - Add touchDragState to component state with isDragging, draggedSkill, positions, and draggedElement properties
  - Create handleTouchStart function to initialize touch drag operations and prevent default behaviors
  - Create handleTouchMove function to update drag position and provide real-time visual feedback
  - Create handleTouchEnd function to process drop operations and reset touch state
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.3_



- [ ] 2. Implement touch event integration with skill cards
  - Add onTouchStart, onTouchMove, and onTouchEnd handlers to skill card elements
  - Integrate touch handlers with existing draggable elements without breaking mouse functionality
  - Ensure touch events work alongside existing draggedSkillId state management


  - Add touch-specific CSS classes for visual feedback during touch operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 3. Create touch-based drop zone detection system
  - Implement elementFromPoint-based drop zone detection for touch coordinates


  - Create function to identify bucket elements under touch position during drag operations
  - Integrate touch drop detection with existing handleBucketDrop logic
  - Add visual feedback for valid drop zones during touch drag operations
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2_



- [ ] 4. Add visual feedback and animations for touch interactions
  - Implement real-time position updates for dragged elements during touch move
  - Create smooth animations for touch drag operations using CSS transforms
  - Add visual highlighting for drop zones when touch drag is over valid targets
  - Implement return-to-origin animation for cancelled or invalid drops


  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 5.2_

- [ ] 5. Implement touch event performance optimizations
  - Add requestAnimationFrame throttling for touchmove events to improve performance
  - Implement efficient touch event cleanup and memory management


  - Add touch event debouncing to prevent accidental drag initiation from quick taps
  - Optimize DOM queries and element position calculations for mobile performance
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 6. Add error handling and edge case management for touch interactions



  - Implement graceful handling of interrupted touch events (system gestures, notifications)
  - Add validation to prevent touch dragging of already placed skills
  - Create fallback behavior for touch events outside valid interaction areas
  - Add error boundaries and cleanup for touch event handler failures
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 7. Ensure cross-platform compatibility and input method coexistence
  - Test and ensure mouse and touch events work simultaneously without conflicts
  - Add device detection to optimize touch behavior for different screen sizes
  - Implement proper event prevention to avoid mouse events firing after touch events
  - Validate consistent game state management across different input methods
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive tests for touch drag and drop functionality
  - Write unit tests for touch event handlers and state management functions
  - Create integration tests for complete touch drag and drop workflows
  - Add tests for touch and mouse input method compatibility
  - Implement tests for game completion scenarios using touch interactions
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
