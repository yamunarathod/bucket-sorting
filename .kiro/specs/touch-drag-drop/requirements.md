# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add touch screen support to the existing drag and drop game functionality, allowing users to play the Flipkart Seller Hub Sorting Game on mobile devices and tablets. Currently, the game only supports mouse-based drag and drop interactions, limiting accessibility for touch device users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to drag and drop skill cards using touch gestures, so that I can play the game on my smartphone or tablet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user touches a skill card THEN the system SHALL initiate a drag operation
2. WHEN a user moves their finger while touching a skill card THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing the card is being dragged
3. WHEN a user lifts their finger over a bucket THEN the system SHALL drop the skill card into that bucket
4. WHEN a user lifts their finger outside of any bucket THEN the system SHALL return the skill card to its original position

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a touch device user, I want visual feedback during drag operations, so that I understand what is happening during the interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts dragging a skill card THEN the system SHALL show visual feedback indicating the card is being dragged
2. WHEN a dragged card is over a valid drop zone THEN the system SHALL highlight the drop zone
3. WHEN a dragged card is moved THEN the system SHALL update the card's visual position in real-time
4. IF a drag operation is cancelled THEN the system SHALL animate the card back to its original position

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game player, I want the touch drag and drop to work seamlessly with the existing game logic, so that the scoring and game flow remain consistent regardless of input method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a skill card is dropped via touch THEN the system SHALL apply the same scoring logic as mouse-based drops
2. WHEN a skill card is correctly placed via touch THEN the system SHALL increment the score and show the same animations
3. WHEN all skills are placed via touch interactions THEN the system SHALL end the game with the same completion logic
4. IF a skill card is already placed THEN the system SHALL prevent touch-based dragging of that card

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want both mouse and touch interactions to work simultaneously, so that the game is accessible regardless of the input method available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects mouse events THEN it SHALL handle them with the existing mouse-based drag and drop logic
2. WHEN the system detects touch events THEN it SHALL handle them with the new touch-based drag and drop logic
3. WHEN both mouse and touch events are available THEN the system SHALL handle both input methods without conflicts
4. IF a user switches between input methods during gameplay THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent game state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the touch interactions to feel natural and responsive, so that the game provides a smooth user experience on touch devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user touches a skill card THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms
2. WHEN a user drags a skill card THEN the system SHALL update the visual position smoothly without lag
3. WHEN a user performs a quick tap without dragging THEN the system SHALL NOT initiate a drag operation
4. WHEN a user accidentally touches other elements while dragging THEN the system SHALL maintain the drag operation focus on the skill card
