# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds API integration to the bucket sorting game to automatically send game results to a webhook endpoint when players complete the game. The system will capture player email, score, and other game metadata and transmit it to an external service for data collection and analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game administrator, I want to automatically collect game results data, so that I can analyze player performance and engagement metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player completes the game THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to the webhook endpoint with game results
2. WHEN the game ends due to time expiration THEN the system SHALL send the results data with the current score
3. WHEN all skills are correctly placed before time expires THEN the system SHALL send the results data immediately
4. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but not interrupt the user experience

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to receive structured game data, so that I can process and analyze player performance consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending game results THEN the system SHALL include the player's email address
2. WHEN sending game results THEN the system SHALL include the final score as a number
3. WHEN sending game results THEN the system SHALL include a fixed element_id of "05"
4. WHEN sending game results THEN the system SHALL include a fixed game_name of "Bucket Sorting"
5. WHEN sending game results THEN the system SHALL include a fixed location of "surat"
6. WHEN sending game results THEN the system SHALL format the data as JSON with the exact structure: {"email": "$EMAIL","element_id": "05","game_name": "Bucket Sorting","location": "surat","score": $SCORE}

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API integration to be reliable and non-blocking, so that technical issues don't affect the player experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API request is made THEN the system SHALL not block the UI or delay showing results to the player
2. IF the network request fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN the API request is in progress THEN the system SHALL not prevent the player from seeing their results
4. IF the webhook endpoint is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue normal game operation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API integration to be configurable and maintainable, so that I can easily update endpoints or modify the data structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the API integration THEN the webhook URL SHALL be easily configurable
2. WHEN sending data THEN the system SHALL use proper HTTP headers for JSON content
3. WHEN making the API request THEN the system SHALL use appropriate error handling and timeout settings
4. IF the data structure needs to change THEN the system SHALL allow easy modification of the payload format
